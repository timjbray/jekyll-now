title: Google Analytics and Tag Manager

Now I have a simple blog platform using Jekyll & GitHub Pages, I need to see whether anyone is looking at it!

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is super simple to add to Jekyll site. Jump over to [https://analytics.google.com/](https://analytics.google.com/) sign up for a free Analytics account, then create a new Property (Website to track). Copy the *Tracking ID* (in the form UA-XXXXXXXX-X) and copy into your _config.yml file.

```YAML
# Enter your Google Analytics web tracking code (e.g. UA-XXXXXXXX-X) to activate tracking
google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXX-X
```

### Google Tag Manager 

Google Tag Manager is just slightly more involved to setup.
