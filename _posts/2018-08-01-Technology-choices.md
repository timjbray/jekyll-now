title: Technology choices

In my [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-01-File-New-Project %}) I talked about some of my thinking around choosing technology and how it fits alongside solid processes and tooling. 

This post outlines some technology I've been using recently. 

## Tools and platforms

- gitlab - git, issues, CI/CD
- Google cloud platform (GCP)

## Core technology

- postgres (hosted on GCP)
- nodejs
- graphql
- React
- React Native for building iOS & Android apps

## Additional services / tools

- Senty 
- Stackdriver 
- Firebase
- Fastlane for publishing mobile apps
- Prettier.io - formatting code

Over time, I'll try to build out the reasoning behind each selection.
