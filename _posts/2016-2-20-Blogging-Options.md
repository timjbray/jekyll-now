title: Blogging Options
---

There appears to be more blogging options around now than ever before. Although a lot of the popular platforms of the past are being overtaken by more modern, simpler solutions - like medium.com.

I'm after something really simple and easy to manage. 

So far one of the top option appears to be [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/). 

Upsides
- Blog posts are version controlled and local
- Simple text/markdown editing. Use you favourite editor
- Free with reasonable usage limits

Downsides
- Need to set it up & know Git (slightly easier with [JekyllNow](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) & SourceTree)
- SEO & discoverability. You're probably going to be talking in a vacuum
- Harder for non-coders. Managing files, linking images, web links etc.

Watch this space to see if it's successful...
