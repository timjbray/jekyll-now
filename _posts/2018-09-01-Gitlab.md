title: Why we switched to GitLab
---

One of the first services you sign up to when creating software is an online Source Control Management (SCM) service. [GitHub](https://github.com) is the largest and the most well-known, and was the first service we signed up to. 

One of my colleagues suggested we try [GitLab](https://gitlab.com). I was initially apprehensive - I like to use standards and whatever the masses are using. I use [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) for personal projects (and liked their free unlimited private repositories - up to 5 users), but hadn't ever used GitLab. 

What made the decision easier was ...pricing! GitLab has an awesome free plan: Unlimited private projects and collaborators for free. We initially would have at least a dozen contributors on our project, so this sealed the deal!

## Initial Impressions

Git is Git. At least from the command line, or through a GUI (I tend to use SourceTree for visualizing changes). So initially it makes no difference what service you use. It's the add-ons and the extra functionality that really differentiate the choices.

GitLab, BitBucket & GitHub offer Issue tracking & documentation (via wiki), but GitLab has taken a different approach by including CI/CD pipelines.

## Continuous Integration & Delivery Pipelines

GitLab [CI/CD Pipelines](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/) enable building, testing, deploying & monitoring code. There's a lot going here. Back in my previous post [File > New Project]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-01-File-New-Project %}) I said:

It's essential for successful projects. Using this DevOps mindset from the start of a project is super helpful. Having this built into the platform makes a lot of sense. As long as it works...

It's super easy to get started just put a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file into the root of your project and configure a Runner to execute the commands. The yml file will contain options (eg. branches to monitor) and build, test or deployment commands. Whenever GitLab sees a new commit or push in a monitored branch, it will start a new Runner and execute the appropriate commands from the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. 

I'm not a fan of `yml`, but it is pretty easy to understand. What is a painful, is testing your configuration. This is usually some trial and error, make a change, commit/push, watch how it worked & repeat. Although, GitLab does have a CI Lint tool that checks if your yml is valid.

## Summary

I expected to use another tool for our CI/CD piplines. Having this inbuilt into GitLab enabled us to get our pipelines up and running quickly. Can't argue with the price either.

I expect in future we'll outgrow GitLab's CI/CD and want to use something more sophisticated, but until then we'll concentrate on coding and building our software.
