title: You build it - you run it

### "You build it, you run it" - Werner Vogels 

In a previous role this was a hard concept to get across to my engineering teams - especially 5-10 years ago. 
Today most engineers understand the concepts and benefits of DevOps - but this wasn't the case 
10 years ago when the concept was first floated. Engineers were generally kept at arms distance to both production (and customers).
