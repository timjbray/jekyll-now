Curious about everything. Passionate about technology.

I started my career as a software developer, and still love writing code and solving problems. 
But prefer to have more impact and be involved across a wider area of business. 
Including product strategy, business development and most importantly, working with customers.

These days I spend most of my time solving problems across product, teams, tech, architecture, systems and platforms.

I'm currently building a new business with a range of exciting new technologies.
