Curious about everything. Constantly learning. Passionate about technology.

I started my career as a software developer. While writing code is great, I found out I like to be involved with product management, business development and the full SDLC.

These days I spend most of my time solving problems across product, teams, tech, architecture, systems and platforms.

I'm currently building a new business with some exciting new technology.
